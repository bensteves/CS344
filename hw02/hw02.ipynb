    "Q4: One thing I had to decide was what I needed to set the batch size as - it failed with 64 since there are only 41 images, so I opted to go with a batch size of 4. In data collection, I felt that I needed to try and get a few pictures from different angles and sides of the buildings, and I took some photos in small bursts, moving the camera slightly. I feel like I did okay at collecting the data and taking the pictures given that I have mediocre photography skills. It would have been nice to take some photos at different times of the day - one flaw potentially with the dataset is that for each building, I only took photos on two different days. It would have been interesting to have variations in lighting, shadow, time of day, weather, etc. I think the dataset would be a little bit more versatile with this added - it would probably be more trained on the building itself rather than the building AND the hue of the sky."
